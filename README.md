In this repository I used a plugin annotator viewer (https://github.com/albertjuhe/annotator_view)
I have already done a small project using annotaterjs and an offline plugin (https://github.com/csadusky/notes)
I want to add on to this functionality and add a side panel which allows you to see all the highlights you've
made along with the notes for each.
